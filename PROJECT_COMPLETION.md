## Implementation Guides

We've created several guides to help you complete any remaining tasks:

- `XCODE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - How to set up the Xcode project
- `ASSET_CREATION_GUIDE.md` - How to create graphics for the game
- `GAME_CENTER_GUIDE.md` - How to set up Game Center integration
- `SOUND_FILES_NOTE.md` - Information about required sound files

## Next Steps

1. Follow the `ASSET_CREATION_GUIDE.md` to create duck sprites and other graphics
2. Set up your Xcode project following `XCODE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
3. Create/obtain sound files as described in `SOUND_FILES_NOTE.md`
4. Test the game on a real device
5. Configure Game Center following `GAME_CENTER_GUIDE.md`

## Credits

This project was created by transforming the original Flappy Bird Swift implementation. All new code and features were custom-developed for Floppy Duck.
