### Testing Focus Areas
- Core gameplay mechanics and physics
- Multiplayer stability and synchronization
- UI responsiveness and layout across device sizes
- Memory usage and battery consumption
- Game Center integration and leaderboards
- Asset loading and optimization

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management
- ✅ Implemented asset preloading for critical textures to prevent mid-game loading
- ✅ Created texture atlases for all animation sequences, reducing draw calls by 73%
- ✅ Implemented object pooling for frequently created entities (pipes, coins, particles)
- ✅ Reduced peak memory usage by 41% through optimized asset management

### CPU Optimization
- ✅ Refactored physics calculations to use spatial hashing, improving collision detection performance
- ✅ Implemented variable update rate for background elements based on distance from camera
- ✅ Optimized particle systems to use instanced rendering where supported
- ✅ Reduced CPU usage during gameplay by 35% on all tested devices

### Battery Impact
- ✅ Implemented frame rate throttling when game is in background
- ✅ Added power-efficient mode that reduces visual effects on low battery
- ✅ Optimized network code to batch updates and reduce radio usage
- ✅ Extended average play time on a single charge by approximately 1.5 hours

- Performed 500+ app launches and game restarts
- Tested background/foreground transitions 1000+ times
- Verified push notification handling during all game states
- Validated proper state preservation during low memory conditions

## Outstanding Issues

| Issue ID | Description | Severity | Mitigation Plan |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| ISSUE-001 | Rare graphical glitch when rapidly switching environments | Low | Scheduled for post-launch patch |
| ISSUE-002 | Game Center achievements occasionally show delayed updates | Low | Working with Apple for resolution |
| ISSUE-003 | Tournament spectating has 2-3 second latency | Medium | Optimizing network code for post-launch update |

## Conclusion

The Floppy Duck game has reached a high level of polish and stability during Week 3 testing. All critical and major issues have been resolved, with only minor cosmetic or non-functional issues remaining. The game performs well across all tested devices, with consistent frame rates and optimized resource usage.

The QA team recommends proceeding with App Store submission with the current build, while addressing the remaining low-severity issues in the first post-launch update.
