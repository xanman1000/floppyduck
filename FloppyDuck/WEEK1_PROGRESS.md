# Floppy Duck Modernization - Week 1 Progress Report

## Overview

During Week 1, our team has successfully modernized the core structure of the Flappy Bird clone and established the foundation for all the requested new features. We've transitioned the project from the old FlappyBird codebase to the new Floppy Duck brand with significant architectural improvements and modernization.

## Completed Tasks

### iOS Framework Modernization
- ✅ Updated the AppDelegate to support modern iOS (17+) app lifecycle
- ✅ Added SceneDelegate for iOS 13+ scene-based lifecycle
- ✅ Updated Info.plist with necessary permissions and app capabilities
- ✅ Implemented proper GameKit integration for modern devices
- ✅ Added support for deep linking through custom URL scheme

### Game Physics
- ✅ Created a dedicated GamePhysics module to ensure consistent physics matching original Flappy Bird
- ✅ Abstracted collision detection and physics configuration
- ✅ Standardized physics constants for consistent gameplay across devices
- ✅ Implemented utilities for physics body configuration

### Environment & Theming
- ✅ Created EnvironmentManager to adapt the game to user's local time
- ✅ Implemented support for dawn, day, dusk, and night appearances
- ✅ Added dynamic sun positioning based on local time
- ✅ Integrated location services for accurate time-of-day representation

### Customization
- ✅ Implemented CustomizationManager for duck skins and themes
- ✅ Defined multiple unlockable duck skins (classic, golden, pixel, etc.)
- ✅ Added game themes (classic, meadow, desert, snow, neon)
- ✅ Created unlocking mechanism based on player achievements

### Social & Sharing
- ✅ Built SocialSharingManager for sharing scores and achievements
- ✅ Added score image generation for social sharing
- ✅ Implemented achievement sharing functionality
- ✅ Created friend challenge system through Game Center

### Multiplayer Foundation
- ✅ Designed TournamentManager for tournament-style gameplay
- ✅ Implemented bracket generation and tournament tracking
- ✅ Added score submission and tournament advancement logic
- ✅ Created the foundation for head-to-head matchmaking

## Pending Tasks for Week 2

1. **Asset Creation**
   - Duck sprite animations for all skin variants
   - Theme-specific backgrounds and obstacles
   - UI elements for menus and customization screens

2. **Game Scene Updates**
   - Refactor GameScene.swift to use new physics module
   - Implement environment changes based on time of day
   - Add visual effects for different themes

3. **Multiplayer Implementation**
   - Complete real-time head-to-head gameplay
   - Implement spectator mode for tournaments
   - Add tournament UI and flow

4. **Leaderboard & UI Refinement**
   - Complete leaderboard integration
   - Polish UI for all screens
   - Implement smooth transitions between game states

## Technical Highlights

- The new architecture follows a modular approach with dedicated managers for different aspects of the game
- All new code follows Swift's latest best practices with appropriate use of optionals, error handling, and type safety
- The custom physics implementation ensures the game feels identical to the original Flappy Bird while allowing for visual customization
- Environment adaptation uses system APIs to create a dynamic gameplay experience that reflects real-world conditions

## Next Steps

The team will focus on completing the asset creation and implementation of the gameplay mechanics in Week 2, followed by multiplayer feature completion and UI refinement in Week 3.
