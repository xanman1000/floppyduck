    private var currentLocale: Locale
    private var translations: [String: String] = [:]
    
    init() {
        currentLocale = Locale.current
        loadTranslations()
    }
    
    func localizedString(for key: String, arguments: [CVarArg] = []) -> String {
        let format = NSLocalizedString(key, comment: "")
        if arguments.isEmpty {
            return format
        } else {
            return String(format: format, arguments: arguments)
        }
    }
    
    func localizedDate(_ date: Date, style: DateFormatter.Style = .medium) -> String {
        let formatter = DateFormatter()
        formatter.dateStyle = style
        formatter.locale = currentLocale
        return formatter.string(from: date)
    }
    
    private func loadTranslations() {
        // Load translations from Localizable.strings
        guard let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "Localizable", ofType: "strings"),
              let dict = NSDictionary(contentsOfFile: path) as? [String: String] else {
            return
        }
        translations = dict
