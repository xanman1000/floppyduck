# Floppy Duck Implementation Guide

This document outlines the changes made to convert the original Flappy Bird game to Floppy Duck, and provides instructions for completing the implementation.

## Changes Made

1. **Codebase Structure**
   - Created a new `FloppyDuck` directory with updated Swift files
   - Added Game Center integration for leaderboards and multiplayer
   - Added player statistics tracking system
   - Added UI for profile, leaderboards, and matchmaking

2. **Game Mechanics**
   - Renamed "bird" to "duck" throughout the codebase
   - Added statistics tracking for flights, distance, and flaps
   - Implemented game state system for menu navigation
   - Added persistent storage for player stats

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Added main menu with buttons for different game modes
   - Created profile screen showing player statistics
   - Added placeholder screens for leaderboards and matchmaking

## Implementation To-Do List

To complete the implementation, you'll need to:

1. **Create Graphics Assets**
   - Replace the bird sprite sheets with duck sprites in `duck.atlas`
   - Update any bird-themed UI elements to match the duck theme
   - Consider updating the pipe graphics to fit the new theme

2. **Build Xcode Project**
   - Create a new Xcode project called "FloppyDuck"
   - Copy all the files from the `FloppyDuck` directory into the project
   - Configure the proper bundle identifier

3. **Game Center Integration**
   - Set up Game Center in your Apple Developer account
   - Create leaderboards for high scores
   - Configure matchmaking for the multiplayer mode

4. **Asset Attribution**
   - Ensure all assets are properly licensed or created
   - Update credits in the README.md as needed

5. **Testing**
   - Test single player gameplay
   - Verify statistics tracking works correctly
   - Test Game Center integration if available

```

## Additional Notes

- The placeholders for graphics (.png files) and the SpriteKit scene file (.sks) need to be replaced with actual binary files
- You may need to adjust the physics parameters for the duck to get the right "feel" for the gameplay
- Consider adding sound effects specific to a duck (quacking) instead of bird sounds
